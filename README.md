# Support-Vector-Squad

The difficulty of maintaining scattered information across platforms such as news websites, chat tools, and emails is addressed by this project, Generalised Lead Management Agent. By consolidating data onto a single dashboard, it makes personalised lead delivery and preference-based filtering possible. Important features include a dashboard that can be customised, regular updates to guarantee data accuracy, and an intelligent chat interface for dynamic interactions. To provide a reliable and scalable solution, the system makes use of contemporary technologies like React.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP). It supports sophisticated visualisation tools like D3.js, real-time data processing, and natural language processing (NLP) for summarisation. The architecture turns lead management into a productive, user-focused experience by combining a personalisation engine, modular input sources, and a smooth user interface.
